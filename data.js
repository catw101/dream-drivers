reviewlist1 = ["I love this dream! I haven't had many dreams at night lately. When I want to escape, the daydream lets me immerse myself in another world. It's better than virtual reality, and half the price!","This nightmare option is really cool! It's not as scary as I expected, but it is lifelike. I'd like to be able to choose monsters though. Other than this, it's the perfect way to find some thrills or even prank your friends!","The action that you find in this dream is not limited, but it isn't very expansive either. There should be more options more readily available, and maybe less of the story that is built in.","The fantasy dream is absolutely amazing! You get to ride dragons, fight monsters, and more! It's more immersive than virtual reality videogames, and less expensive too. It's the best!","The mystery dreams are highly intriguing. It would be better if there were hints, but the investigation is extremely exciting","These lucid dreams allow you to imagine any mixture of the genres offered. They aren't always exactly what you want, but they're better than choosing the closest preset dream. This option allows people to get more for what they pay for."];
reviewlist2 = ["These dreams work well, but I don't know too much about the daydream concept. It makes short naps more enjoyable, but it's too costly. It works well, but you may want to purchase another type of dream.","These nightmares are more thrilling than scary movies and games. They are realistic and scary enough to give me nightmares I didn't actually pay for- which doubles the value of buying this!","Action dreams will give you access to motorcycle stunts, car chases, and dynamite without all of the possible injuries you could get from them. And it costs less to dream it than to get what you need to do it in real life.","The fantasy dream option allows you to use magic, and it is so much more fun than everything else that I have tried. It's better than books and movies because you're actually experiencing it, and everything is a lot more exciting.","I really enjoy the mysteries in the mystery dream. There are so many options, and you don't actually know who did what, so you can try to solve the mystery without knowing and setting someone up to be the villain. It's a lot easier to dream mysteries with this product than by myself!","I love lucid dreaming. I can live however I want in my lucid dreams. They're the best way to dream without limits, and it's the best thing that this company has made."];
